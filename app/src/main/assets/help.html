		<h2>About this App</h2>
With BikeHist you can handle your maintenace data for several bikes. So you can follow through exactly how long the components have held in relation to time and mileage. In order to keep different types of maintenance apart, a event has a 'tag' to group them together, tags in turn are grouped into tag types. This allows an individual data collection for individual purposes. 
<p>
The complete dataset can be saved by importing and exporting, so the data will not get lost when replacing your device. 
<p>
The export directory is External Storage/BikeHist/export
<p>
For devices with Android earlier than 4.4.2, a separate app for picking import file is needed.
<p>
In the pro version data can be synchronized with an external file. This enables the possibility to work with more than one device.  

<h2>Walktrough</h2>
If you have changed a tire on your bike for the first time:
<p>
Go into the configuration an create at least one Bike (e.g. 'Bromton'). 
<p>
Create a Tag Type, for instance 'Wheels'.
<p>
Create a Tag for this TagType, for instance 'Tires' and leave the configuration. 
<p>
In the main view, create an event for the old tire. Distance can be set to '0'. Choose Tag 'Tires' and Date should be the date you bought the bike. The Event name should be the product and vendor name of the tire.
<p>
Create a new event for the new bike. Now you have to set the actual date. Take the distance from your bike computer. Choose 'Tires' for the tag. 
<p>
In the event list you now see both entries, but the one for the old tire has additional values for distance and timespan.


<h2>Data format</h2>
The exchange format of the files is json, equal for ex-/import and synchronizations. Timestamps are Java timestamps and IDs are Java GUIDs.
